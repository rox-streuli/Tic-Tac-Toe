# TIC-TAC-TOE
# #
# Estimated time
# 30-45 minutes
#
# Level of difficulty
# Hard
#
# Objectives
# Learn practical skills related to:
#
#    dealing with the grid geometry manager,

#    defining and using callbacks,

#    identifying and servicing GUI events.

# Scenario
# Write a simple GUI program which pretends to play tic-tac-toe with
# the user. Don't be afraid, we don't want you to implement artificial
# intelligence algorithms. You can do it, if you want, but we prefer
# to concentrate on the user interface issues. If you really want to
# create an actual competitor, do it on your own.
#
# This is what the game you are about to write looks like
# (the beginning and sample end of the game):
#
# To make your task a bit easier, let's simplify the game a bit.
# Here are our assumptions:.
#
#    the computer (i.e., your program) plays 'X', and Xes are always red,

#    the user (e.g., you) plays 'O', and Os are always green,

#    the board consists of 9 tiles, and the tile role is played by a button,

#   the first move belongs to the computer - it always puts its first 'X'
#   in the middle of the board,

#   the user enters her/his move by clicking the chosen tile (clicking
#   the tiles which are not free is ineffective)

#   the program checks if the game over conditions are met, and if the
#   game is over, a message box is displayed announcing the winner,

#   otherwise the computer responds with its move and the check is repeated,

#    use random to generate the computer's moves.
